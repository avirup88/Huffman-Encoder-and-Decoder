# Huffman-Encoder-and-Decoder

The purpose of this project is to choose and implement the suitable data structure for generating Huffman codes which is then used for implementing the encoder and decoder programs. The report file given with this project describes the overall program flow with a special emphasis on the decoding algorithm and its complexity. It also includes a comparative study for evaluating performances of 3 data structures for generating Huffman tree.
